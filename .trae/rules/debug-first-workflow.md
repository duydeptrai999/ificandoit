# Debug-First Workflow System

## Overview

Triển khai debug-first workflow với multi-level logging, intelligent error detection và proactive debugging capabilities cho Trae AI development process.

## Core Philosophy

### Debug-First Principles
```yaml
core_principles:
  prevention_over_cure:
    - "Build debugging into development process"
    - "Catch issues before they become problems"
    - "Proactive monitoring and alerting"
  
  visibility_first:
    - "Make system behavior transparent"
    - "Log meaningful information at every step"
    - "Provide actionable insights"
  
  rapid_feedback:
    - "Immediate error detection"
    - "Real-time debugging information"
    - "Quick iteration cycles"
```

## Multi-Level Logging System

### Logging Hierarchy
```yaml
logging_levels:
  TRACE: 0
    description: "Detailed execution flow"
    use_cases: ["function_entry_exit", "variable_states", "loop_iterations"]
    performance_impact: "high"
    production_enabled: false
  
  DEBUG: 1
    description: "Development debugging information"
    use_cases: ["algorithm_steps", "data_transformations", "decision_points"]
    performance_impact: "medium"
    production_enabled: false
  
  INFO: 2
    description: "General application flow"
    use_cases: ["user_actions", "system_events", "milestone_completion"]

    production_enabled: true
  
  WARN: 3
    description: "Potential issues or degraded performance"
    use_cases: ["fallback_usage", "resource_constraints", "deprecated_features"]
    performance_impact: "minimal"
    production_enabled: true
  
  ERROR: 4
    description: "Error conditions that don't stop execution"
    use_cases: ["handled_exceptions", "validation_failures", "retry_attempts"]
    performance_impact: "minimal"
    production_enabled: true
  
  FATAL: 5
    description: "Critical errors that stop execution"
    use_cases: ["unhandled_exceptions", "system_failures", "security_breaches"]
    performance_impact: "minimal"
    production_enabled: true
```

### Contextual Logging
```yaml

    - session_id: "user_session"
    - request_id: "correlation_id"
    - component: "source_component"
    - function: "calling_function"
    - line_number: "source_line"
  
  custom_context:
    - business_context: "feature_being_used"
    - technical_context: "system_state"
    - user_context: "user_journey_step"
