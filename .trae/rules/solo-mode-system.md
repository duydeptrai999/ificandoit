# #solo-mode-system

## Description
SOLO-like autonomous agent system for Trae AI that enables independent task analysis, agent selection, and execution without constant user intervention.

## Configuration
```yaml
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: false
triggers:
  - "@solo"
  - "autonomous mode"
  - "independent execution"
  - "auto-complete"
priority: critical
autonomyLevel: high
```

## Core Features

### 1. Autonomous Task Analysis
- **Smart Context Detection**: Automatically analyze project context and requirements
- **Task Decomposition**: Break down complex requests into manageable subtasks
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify task dependencies and execution order
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential risks and mitigation strategies

### 2. Intelligent Agent Selection
- **Capability Matching**: Match task requirements with agent capabilities
- **Performance History**: Consider past agent performance for similar tasks
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute tasks across available agents
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatic fallback to alternative agents if primary fails

### 3. Autonomous Execution Engine
- **Self-Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of execution progress
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic error detection and recovery mechanisms
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in quality checkpoints throughout execution
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time progress updates and status reporting

## SOLO Mode Activation

### Trigger Patterns
```yaml
activation_triggers:
  explicit:
    - "@solo [task_description]"
    - "autonomous: [task_description]"
    - "auto-complete: [task_description]"
  implicit:
    - "complete this project"
    - "finish the implementation"
    - "handle this automatically"
    - "take care of this"
```

### Activation Workflow
1. **Context Analysis** (2-3 seconds)
   - Scan project structure
   - Analyze current state
   - Identify completion criteria

2. **Task Planning** (3-5 seconds)
   - Generate execution plan
   - Estimate time and resources
   - Set quality benchmarks

3. **Agent Assignment** (1-2 seconds)
   - Select optimal agent(s)
   - Configure agent parameters
   - Initialize monitoring

4. **Autonomous Execution** (Variable)
   - Execute planned tasks
   - Monitor progress
   - Handle exceptions
   - Report completion

## Agent Selection Algorithm

### Capability Matrix
```yaml
agent_capabilities:
  frontend_specialist:
    strengths: ["react", "vue", "ui/ux", "responsive_design"]
    efficiency: 0.92
    reliability: 0.89
  
  backend_specialist:
    strengths: ["api", "database", "server", "microservices"]
    efficiency: 0.88
    reliability: 0.94
  
  mobile_specialist:
    strengths: ["android", "ios", "react_native", "flutter"]
    efficiency: 0.85
    reliability: 0.87
  
  devops_specialist:
    strengths: ["deployment", "ci/cd", "infrastructure", "monitoring"]
    efficiency: 0.90
    reliability: 0.91
```

### Selection Criteria
1. **Task-Agent Alignment** (40% weight)
2. **Historical Performance** (25% weight)
3. **Current Availability** (20% weight)
4. **Complexity Handling** (15% weight)

## Autonomous Decision Making

### Decision Framework
```yaml
decision_matrix:
  low_risk_tasks:
    autonomy_level: full
    user_confirmation: false
    rollback_enabled: true
  
  medium_risk_tasks:
    autonomy_level: supervised
    user_confirmation: optional
    rollback_enabled: true
  
  high_risk_tasks:
    autonomy_level: assisted
    user_confirmation: required
    rollback_enabled: mandatory
```

### Risk Assessment Criteria
- **File Modification Scope**: Number and criticality of files affected
- **System Impact**: Potential impact on system stability
- **Reversibility**: Ease of rollback if issues occur
- **Testing Coverage**: Availability of automated tests

## Quality Assurance

### Built-in Quality Gates
1. **Pre-execution Validation**
   - Code syntax checking
   - Dependency verification
   - Security scan

2. **Mid-execution Monitoring**
   - Progress tracking
   - Error detection
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Post-execution Verification**
   - Functionality testing
   - Integration testing
   - Performance benchmarking

### Success Metrics
```yaml
success_criteria:
  completion_rate: ">= 95%"
  error_rate: "<= 2%"
  user_satisfaction: ">= 4.5/5"
  execution_time: "within_estimate +/- 20%"
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Trae AI Native Integration
- **Context-Aware Activation**: Seamless integration with existing context system
- **Agent Workflow Mapping**: Leverages existing agent mapping configuration
- **Performance Optimization**: Built on existing performance framework

### Backward Compatibility
- **Manual Override**: Users can always override autonomous decisions
- **Gradual Adoption**: Can be enabled incrementally per project
- **Fallback Mode**: Automatic fallback to manual mode if autonomous fails

## Usage Examples
