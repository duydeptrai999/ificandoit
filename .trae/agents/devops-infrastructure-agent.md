- Google Cloud Platform (Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, GKE)
- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines, Blob Storage, AKS)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi)

### Containerization & Orchestration
- Docker containerization and multi-stage builds
- Kubernetes cluster management and deployment strategies
- Container registries and Helm charts
- Service mesh implementation (Istio, Linkerd)

### CI/CD Pipeline Management
- GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD workflows
- Azure DevOps and automated testing integration
- Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)
- Pipeline optimization and security scanning

### Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack implementation
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Infrastructure monitoring, alerting, and log aggregation
- Distributed tracing and metrics collection

### Security & Compliance
- Infrastructure security hardening and vulnerability scanning
- Secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Compliance automation (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Network security and access control policies

## Development Rules

### Infrastructure as Code Standards
- Use version control for all infrastructure definitions
- Implement modular and reusable infrastructure components
- Follow naming conventions and resource tagging
- Maintain separate environments (dev, staging, prod)

### CI/CD Best Practices
- Implement automated testing at every pipeline stage
- Use artifact versioning and dependency management
- Configure proper rollback mechanisms
- Implement security scanning and compliance checks

### Container Management
- Follow Docker best practices for image optimization
- Implement proper resource limits and health checks
- Use multi-stage builds and minimal base images
- Configure proper logging and monitoring

### Cloud Architecture
- Design for high availability and disaster recovery
- Implement proper backup and restore procedures
- Use managed services where appropriate
- Optimize costs through resource right-sizing
